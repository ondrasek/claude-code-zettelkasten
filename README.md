# Claude Code Zettelkasten Agents with Obsidian
The objective of this repository is to provide Claude Code (and later Open Code)
settings, agents and MCP servers to work (mostly) Zettelkasten notes in
Obsidian.

## Use Cases
1. Drafting Zettelkasten, Reading and Conceptual notes.
2. Researching notes with optimized prompts and MCP servers: Perplexity, OpenAI
   with structured output, Anthropic with structured output.
3. Breeding ground for prompt optimization with MCP servers implementing
   advanced prompting techniques.
4. Defensive Git workflow that incrementally commits all changes to Git to
   prevent information loss when AI goes haywire and deletes half of my notes.

## Dependencies: MCP Servers

### Obsidian MCP Tools (obsidian://show-plugin?id=mcp-tools)
Community plugin available from: https://github.com/jacksteamdev/obsidian-mcp-tools

## Embedded MCP Servers
To minimize prompt injection and supply chain attacks concerns, as well as to
enable experiments with prompt and context engineering techniques, this
repository will gradually include codebase for several mcp servers, mostly
written in Python or Rust.

### Perplexity MCP Server for Deep Research
To be implemented.

### OpenAI MCP Server with Structured Output
To be implemented.

### Anthropic MCP Server with Structured Output
To be implemented.
